# Swisscenter language file 
# -------------------------
#
# A swisscenter languiage file consists of a mapping from internal program ID (eg: "ADD_PLAYLIST") 
# to the actual text that should be displayed to the user (eg: "Add to your playulist") as follows:
# 
#   <ID> = <text>
#
# NOTE: The text cannot span multiple lines. If a line break or paragraph break are required within
#       the text then markup tags should be used (see below).
#
# The <text> may contain a limited number of markup tags which are indicated by square brackets
# and perform an identical function to their HTML counterparts. The following tags are supported:
#
#  [br][/br]  [em][/em]  [p][/p]  [b][/b]  [i][/i]  [li][/li]  [ul][\ul]  [ol][/ul]
#
# In some circumstances, other text may need to be substituted within the text. Placeholders for
# the position within the string where the substitution occurs are indicated with '%s'.
#
# EG: In the ID below, the number of tracks that has been found within the database is substituted 
# for the %s within the string... so a search returning 4 tracks would be displayed to the user 
# as "4 Tracks"
#
#   MANY_TRACKS= %s Tracks
# 
# Finally, Lines that begin with a hash (#) are considered to be comments and are ignored.
#

IRADIO_MAX_STATIONS        = Max stations/genre
IRADIO_MAX_STATIONS_PROMPT = Maximum number of radio stations to retrieve per genre. The more is [b]not[/b] the better: Putting this number to high will not only increase the time to retrieve them (and thus make a browser timeout more likely), but also the possibility of an "out-of-memory" error from PHP. A good number is 24. Reduce it, if you encounter one of the mentioned possible errors.
IRADIO_CACHE_EXPIRE        = Cache Timeout
IRADIO_CACHE_EXPIRE_PROMPT = SwissCenter can cache station information. But since the station list will continuously be changing, we should refresh them from time to time. One hour (3600s) is a good compromise.

MIP_VARIETY                = Variety
MIP_VARIETY_PROMPT         = Allows you to specify how much variety you like to have in your mix. The higher the setting, the more variety will be introduced into the mix.
MIP_REJECT                 = Artist Repeat

To reduce the complexity of the interface or to customise it more to your liking you can disable any of the "Browse by..." options shown below. If only one option is enabled then SwissCenter will jump straight to that option instead of showing a menu. [p]Please note that you must leave at least [b]one[/b] option enabled in each group.
