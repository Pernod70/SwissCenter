# Swisscenter language file 
# -------------------------
#
# A swisscenter languiage file consists of a mapping from internal program ID (eg: "ADD_PLAYLIST") 
# to the actual text that should be displayed to the user (eg: "Add to your playulist") as follows:
# 
#   <ID> = <text>
#
# NOTE: The text cannot span multiple lines. If a line break or paragraph break are required within
#       the text then markup tags should be used (see below).
#
# The <text> may contain a limited number of markup tags which are indicated by square brackets
# and perform an identical function to their HTML counterparts. The following tags are supported:
#
#  [br][/br]  [em][/em]  [p][/p]  [b][/b]  [i][/i]  [li][/li]  [ul][\ul]  [ol][/ul]
#
# In some circumstances, other text may need to be substituted within the text. Placeholders for
# the position within the string where the substitution occurs are indicated with '%s'.
#
# EG: In the ID below, the number of tracks that has been found within the database is substituted 
# for the %s within the string... so a search returning 4 tracks would be displayed to the user 
# as "4 Tracks"
#
#   MANY_TRACKS= %s Tracks
# 
# Finally, Lines that begin with a hash (#) are considered to be comments and are ignored.
