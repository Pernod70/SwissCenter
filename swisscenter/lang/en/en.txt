# Swisscenter language file 
# -------------------------
#
# A swisscenter languiage file consists of a mapping from internal program ID (eg: "ADD_PLAYLIST") 
# to the actual text that should be displayed to the user (eg: "Add to your playulist") as follows:
# 
#   <ID> = <text>
#
# NOTE: The text cannot span multiple lines. If a line break or paragraph break are required within
#       the text then markup tags should be used (see below).
#
# The <text> may contain a limited number of markup tags which are indicated by square brackets
# and perform an identical function to their HTML counterparts. The following tags are supported:
#
#  [br][/br]  [em][/em]  [p][/p]  [b][/b]  [i][/i]  [li][/li]  [ul][\ul]  [ol][/ul]
#
# In some circumstances, other text may need to be substituted within the text. Placeholders for
# the position within the string where the substitution occurs are indicated with '%s'.
#
# EG: In the ID below, the number of tracks that has been found within the database is substituted 
# for the %s within the string... so a search returning 4 tracks would be displayed to the user 
# as "4 Tracks"
#
#   MANY_TRACKS= %s Tracks
# 
# Finally, Lines that begin with a hash (#) are considered to be comments and are ignored.
#

NOW_PLAYING_PROMPT      = Some hardware players allow a picture to be displayed whilst a music track is played - and they request it automatically on title change. SwissCenter uses this feature to display details on the current track.[p]In most cases, SwissCenter is able to automatically decide if your player supports this, but if you experience problems then it is possible to override the setting here.[p]So the settings mean: Enabled - the player requests the corresponding picture automatically. Disabled - the player does not request automatically, and SwissCenter tells it by the playlist to request a new one in a given time interval. Automatic - let SwissCenter find out.

IRADIO_NO_STATIONS_MSG     = No stations could be found that match your search for '%s'
IRADIO_MAX_STATIONS        = Max stations/genre
IRADIO_MAX_STATIONS_PROMPT = Maximum number of radio stations to retrieve per genre. The more is [b]not[/b] the better: Putting this number to high will not only increase the time to retrieve them (and thus make a browser timeout more likely), but also the possibility of an "out-of-memory" error from PHP. A good number is 24. Reduce it, if you encounter one of the mentioned possible errors.
IRADIO_CACHE_EXPIRE        = Cache Timeout
IRADIO_CACHE_EXPIRE_PROMPT = SwissCenter can cache station information. But since the station list will continuously be changing, we should refresh them from time to time. One hour (3600s) is a good compromise.

MIP_DESC                   = MusicIP (available free from %s) is a great piece of software which analyses your music collection and generates an "acoustic fingerprint" of each song. This information is then used to generate a personal playlist of similar tracks based on a selected track, artist or album. [p]If MusicIP is installed on the same machine as SwissCenter, then extra features become available to generate and listen to MusicIP playlists directly from within the SwissCenter interface.

MIP_STYLE                  = Style
MIP_STYLE_PROMPT           = This setting allows you to specify how closely the style of the artists within the mix will match the seed song. A high number will probably result in only a few different artists being chosen, while a small number will allow more variation in style.
MIP_VARIETY                = Variety
MIP_VARIETY_PROMPT         = Allows you to specify how much variety you like to have in your mix. The higher the setting, the more variety will be introduced into the mix.
MIP_REJECT                 = Artist Repeat
MIP_REJECT_PROMPT          = You can prevent the same artist being played twice within a set time period (or number of tracks) using this option.
MIP_SIZE                   = Playlist Size

FAIL_SHOUTCAST_TEST        = ShoutCast parser looks broken

IRADIO_SHOUTCAST_DESC      = ShoutCast (%s) is a radio service on the internet, providing audio streams playable by most streaming devices (and programs). It provides the functionality to search by genre or station name, and returns many details for each station found, including a playlist URL. The ShoutCast parser used by SwissCenter parses the HTML of the result page, to display the result set in a way easy to read also on TV screens. However, it may break when the page structure will be changed by the ShoutCast staff.[p]Sometimes ShoutCast pretends to have no stations listed for our search. So if the test seems to fail, better load the page again - to ensure the problem is not located here.
FAIL_LIVERADIO_TEST        = LiveRadio parser looks broken
PASS_LIVERADIO_TEST        = LiveRadio parser seems to work properly
IRADIO_LIVERADIO_DESC      = LiveRadio (%s) is an internet radio service similiar to ShoutCast. It provides the functionality to search by media type, genre, station name, country and even city - but many stations listed here are not supported by some hardware players. So the LiveRadio parser used by SwissCenter restricts the results to show only MP3 stations.
